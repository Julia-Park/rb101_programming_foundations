Things to think about from lesson
1.  You can also use Integer() or Float() methods to convert.  These will return nil if the conversion can't happen with the whole string.
2.  In both cases, conversion stops at the first non-number character.  If it starts with a non-number character, it returns 0 or 0.0.
3.  Should assign case to a variable and then have it be returned at the end of the method, if additional code needs to be put in after case.
4.  DSL - Domain Specific Language (language of limited expressiveness focused on a particular domain)
